First of all you have to execute server side, you can do this in app/api folder by running ```go run main.go```.<br>
Go to client folder in app/, run ```npm i``` to install all dependencies, then ```npm run dev``` to run frontend.<br>
Next step you have to fill your elasticsearch CloudId and APIKey in app/api/utils/vars.go.<br>
